git init .		-> Make a new folder and write
				This initializes the git repository.

git status		-> Gives status about the directory

git add 'filename'	-> Add the filename to staging area. Not committed yet!

git commit -m 'message'	-> Commits to changes. -am will add and commit with a message.

git diff 'filename'	-> will find what new is added in the file. This will be before the commit.

git log			-> Will find previous commits and changes.

Branches ---------------------

When working on the code, when the thing is working properly and we want to test out some changes,
we branch out from the main code, test the new thing. If it works, we merge it with the earlier master branch.
Code from one branch does not get mixed with code from other branch.
Great for collaborative working.


git branch 'branch_name'-> Will make a new branch with name branch_name

git branch		-> Will print name of created branches.

git checkout 'branch_name' -> Will shift to other branch.


Merging-------------------------

After developing various branches, we need to merge it in a single code base.
